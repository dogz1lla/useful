# useful
A collection of useful routines

In this repo i will store some useful pieces of code. The following tasks are considered:

1 String handling:

  1.1 "Analyze" a line from the standard input, i.e., print the number of characters in the line and their type;

  1.2 Cut a line into tokens that are separated by a given delimeter;

2 Graphs

  2.1 Definition of the graph class. One of the methods is Dijkstra's algorithm (finding the shortest path in a non-directed graph)
3 Neural networks
  3.1 A definition of a simple classificator neural network. The example in network.cpp describes a network that can distinguish
      between vectors [1,0] and [0,1].
